    "project_description": "I built an ecommerce web app where users can shop online. It features a homepage, categories, product details, and a secure checkout for authenticated users. The shopping cart is accessible via a sidebar. I used React, React Router DOM for navigation, ContextAPI for global state, and React Query for optimized data handling, fetching products from Fake Store API. The design follows a modern brutalist style. The main challenge was enhancing user experience, improving performance and interactivity with React Query, reducing load times and making navigation smoother."
